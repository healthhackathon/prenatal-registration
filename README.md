## Description of project
Prenatal registration provides expectant mothers with access to nursing services to support their pregnancy. This is particularly important for vulnerable women, such as teen mothers or those with high-risk pregnancies, who can benefit from targeted programs like the Nurse-Family Partnership. The prenatal registration rate is an indication of the acceptability and accessibility of the broader Best Beginnings program to pregnant women.  Prenatal registrations can be done at doctors’ offices, public health units or online at the following website (http://bestbeginnings.fraserhealth.ca/default.aspx)
The prenatal registration rate is a routinely measured indicator at Fraser Health.  It is measured as the Number of women who deliver in FHA that register with Best Beginnings prenatally divided by the total number of women that deliver in FHA.

### See the descriptions of the variables in the data sheets below:
a.      birthcnt= birth count, note that births only to residents that give birth in Fraser Health are counted (people giving birth outside of Fraser Health, may be seeing a physician outside of Fraser Health, and would therefore not be referred for prenatal registration services here)

b.      prenatcnt= prenatal registration count

c.      prenatrate= prenatal registration rate (b/a)

Region is either Fraser Health or the individual health unit names.
The data included starts in quarter 2 of 2014 until quarter 4 of 2016

### Issue:
Currently our target prenatal registration rate is 75%.  Usually 11-13 out of our 17 health units meet the target rate.   Different health care practitioner and patient practices across the regions may lead to lower rates.  Those few health units that don’t meet the target bring the total Fraser health registration below the target rate.  As this is a fairly new indicator, it would be interesting to find out where we could best put our efforts to increase the prenatal registration rate of Fraser Health overall and in those health units that consistently are not able to meet the target, or whether we should re-assess 75% as our target.
